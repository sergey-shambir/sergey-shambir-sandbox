=Introduction =

Python support in `QtCreator` had been requested many times on Qt Interests mail list, some english blogs and on two of the most visited russian IT resources ([http://habrahabr.ru habrahabr.ru] and [http://linux.org.ru linux.org.ru]).

There were several attempts to implement Python support in `QtCreator`:

  # plugin from PySide developers here https://github.com/PySide/QtCreator
  # another plugin here https://qt.gitorious.org/~renatofilho/pyside/renatofilhos-qt-creator
  # Simple IDE inspired by `QtCreator` and written at Python/`PyQt4`: [http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/development/5735975 LOR topic], [http://www.dixen.cz/neeric/1.png screenshot #1], [http://www.dixen.cz/neeric/3.png screenshot #2], [http://www.dixen.cz/neeric/4.png screenshot #3]. This project is abandoned now.

Also there is good python parser in KDevelop IDE (this parser used in plugins 1-2). It includes python 2.7 sources and probably is incompatible with python3, Jython, IronPython and other implementations.

Here are some quotes from the posts on the linux.org.ru forum:

= Possible use cases of python plugins in QtCreator =
  * Create hybrid applications written at both Python and C   languages. Tags: boost::python, `Shed Skin`, embedding python, writing python modules.
  * Develop `PyQt4` and `PySide` applications with good editor, integrated qt designer, integrated help system and debuggers.
  * Use python as utility language for writing tests, scripts, style checkers, converters and code generators
  * Create scripts for desktop Linux (it installs python interpreter and a lot of modules by default)
